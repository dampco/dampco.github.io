“Nude Nudes” (2024)

A nostalgic homage to the bold roadside signage of 1980s Southern California, this piece is inspired by a strip club marquee near LAX that loomed large in my childhood memory. The enclosure was 3D printed, painted, and weathered by hand. Laser-cut acrylic and vinyl form the lettering, and warm LEDs bring the sign to life with a vintage glow.
