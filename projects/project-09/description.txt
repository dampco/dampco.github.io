Damp Co. Badges (2023)

A series of industrial-style badges designed for the fictional Damp Co. brand. One version is laser engraved on black anodized aluminum for a clean, high-contrast finish. The others are acid etched using ferric chloride, giving them a raw, worn-in look that feels pulled straight from a 1950s factory floor. Each badge explores a different method of fabrication while leaning into the gritty, utilitarian aesthetic of mid-century machinery.
