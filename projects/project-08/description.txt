Gravy Bloods (2024)
 A handmade felt banner for Gravy Bloods—my outlaw eating club specializing in tendies, pizza, and cheeseburgers. The letters are laser-cut from felt and machine sewn in what became my first-ever sewing project. It’s a bit rough around the edges, but a solid first attempt. Hopefully the first of many (and neater) banners to come.
