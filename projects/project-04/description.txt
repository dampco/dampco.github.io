CINERAMA (2024)
 Modeled after the legendary Cinerama Dome marquee in Hollywood, this piece pays homage to the golden age of moviegoing and bold mid-century signage. The enclosure was 3D printed, then meticulously finished with Bondo and sanding to eliminate layer lines and create a seamless surface.
Colored acrylic tiles and letterforms were laser cut and press-fit into the frame, capturing the original’s striking geometry. Internal LEDs illuminate the piece, echoing the iconic glow of the Sunset Boulevard landmark.
