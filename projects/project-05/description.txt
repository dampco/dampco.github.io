Red Phone (2022)
 A functional art piece built from a vintage-style no-dial red telephone, this project creates a direct, one-line connection to my best friend. When the handset is lifted, the phone instantly dials out via a Polycom Google Voice VOIP box to a matching red phone at their home—complete with flashing indicator light and that unmistakable mechanical ring.
Equal parts Cold War drama and personal hotline, Red Phone is about keeping things simple, immediate, and analog—even in a digital world.
