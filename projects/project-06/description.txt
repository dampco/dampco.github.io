Navy Seals (2025)
 This pair of lightbox-style displays is inspired by the 1990 action film Navy Seals. Each enclosure is 3D printed, then meticulously bondo’d, sanded, and painted for a clean, solid finish.
Set into the front panels is original artwork by JJ Harrison, UV printed onto acrylic for sharp detail and vivid color. Internal LEDs backlight the pieces, giving the prints a bold cinematic glow that recalls VHS-era video store feel.
